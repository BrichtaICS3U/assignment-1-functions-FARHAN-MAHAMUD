FEEDBACK

Line 6 math library not used

Line 8 Remove my comments to clean up code

Line 20 Functions should *return* a number or string, not print

Line 24 Typo -> ‘conversion’

Line 24 This isn’t an appropriate message for the beginning of the program.

Line 26 Be verbose. CtoF isn’t very clear.

Line 27 What if I want to convert from Fahrenheit?

I’m having a really hard time following the structure of your code. You are using unnecessary if statements and it is hurting the readability of your code.
